# Sport bet real-time

#### This frontend project uses:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- zustand for state management
- Sonner for notifications
- Socket.io for web sockets


### Environment variables
.env
```dotenv
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### What I would have added assuming this enough time

- Make remain time count down
- Update status of game
- Debug why socket close above a while
- Handle authentication and authorization proper
- Ensure the user state is persisted on browser refresh

### How to run

- Ensure the env is added
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`
